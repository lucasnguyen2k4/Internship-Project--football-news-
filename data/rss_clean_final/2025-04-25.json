So I think she’s proud, a little bit stressed but it’s all right.”</p><p>Growing up in Ajat, a village in the Dordogne, Lacroix knew he was never going to follow in his mother Corrine’s footsteps by becoming a doctor. Having moved to Germany from the French side Sochaux as a 20-year-old after coming through the prestigious Clairefontaine academy, he reunited with Oliver Glasner – his former manager at Wolfsburg – in south London last summer. The elegant defender is the heartbeat of the Palace side that will face Aston Villa for a place in the final and has been tipped to win his first senior cap sooner rather than later after representing France at every youth level.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/maxence-lacroix-crystal-palace-one-day-i-will-be-in-france-team-but-want-to-win-fa-cup\">Continue reading...</a>",

Yokohama F.Marinos meet Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr in an Asian Champions League Elite quarter-final with Patrick Kisnorbo is in charge. The 44-year-old is the fourth Australian to occupy the Yokohama hotseat since Postecoglou left for Celtic in 2021 after three years in Japan that must seem happier by the week.</p><p>Rose-tinted glasses can be forgiven in light of Tottenham Hotspur’s current woes. For all the talk about second-season trophies, there should be more about how Postecoglou – in his first J.League campaign with Yokohama in 2018, was saved from relegation only by goal difference. Yokohama were, of course, the second-highest scorers in the league, with just one goal fewer than the champions, in what proved to be the platform for the title-winning season that came next.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2025/apr/26/ange-postecoglou-yokohama-f-marinos-al-nassr-asian-champions-league\">Continue reading...</a>",
