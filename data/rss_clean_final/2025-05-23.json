A home game against relegated Leicester looks to offer the perfect opportunity but the closing stretch has been tough for Andoni Iraola’s side, with the past 12 league games producing only two victories. Remarkably, a three-game league form table puts Leicester in fourth after home wins over Southampton and Ipswich either side of a 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest. Perhaps this won’t be the walkover most are expecting, and there could be a wistful feeling in the air at the Vitality on Sunday afternoon.

It was August 2021, he was manager at Everton and he had phoned to ask Madrid’s chief executive, José Ángel Sánchez, about borrowing players, but talk turned to their search for a coach. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-storms\">Zinedine Zidane had walked out</a> again, dropping <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/may/31/zidane-reveals-he-quit-real-madrid-because-he-felt-undermined-by-club-perez\">a letter bomb</a> on the way, and Ancelotti wondered whether they had found anyone yet. Madrid were struggling and Sánchez said no, they were still looking. Which is when the Italian replied that they needed the best and luckily they were already talking to him. “Or have you forgotten about 2014?” he said.</p><p>It was classic Carlo. Gently done, an idea cleverly slipped in as if it were not an idea at all, just a throwaway line, another true word said in jest. And like so much of what he does, it worked wonderfully. In 2014, Madrid’s 12-year wait for the European Cup, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/23/real-madrid-gareth-bale-champions-league-final\">an obsession</a> that had come to feel eternal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/champions-league-final-real-madrid-atletico-madrid-live\">finally ended</a>.
