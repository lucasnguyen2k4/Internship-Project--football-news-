While it’s a state of affairs some trophy-obsessed fans of more elite clubs would argue renders Palace’s 164-year existence a complete exercise in futility, the team from Selhurst Park have contested two FA Cup finals, only to come up short against Manchester United on both occasions. The most recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">was nine years ago</a> in a Wembley showpiece largely remembered for the losing manager’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-miss-big-chance-alan-pardew-jason-puncheon-fa-cup-final-manchester-united\">touchline body-popping</a> and the winning one being handed his P45 before his captain was presented with the trophy.

Ramsbottom United amassed 97 points and only finished third; eventual winners and my club Bury finished with a whopping 109. And we still needed a result on the final day to see off Merseyside outfit Lower Breck, with 8,700 people turning up at Gigg Lane to witness it, breaking the league’s attendance record by almost 3,000. Among that crowd was myself and my five-year-old son, who was born <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/bury-football-league-club-fans-club-collapse\">two weeks after we were expelled from the Football League</a>.

All together now, the chant started slowly, quietly, whispered, but the pace quickened and the volume grew bit by bit until they burst to their feet, belted out their name and bounced off each other, footballers fell into the net laughing and one thought emerged above any other: <a href=\"https://x.com/DAZN_ES/status/1915122052618498333\">how much fun they were having</a>.</p><p>This is the way football’s supposed to be – about enjoying, about belonging – and this is the way it has been since Claudio Giráldez came along: good even when it has been bad and getting better all the time. The last time Celta played Villarreal they were beaten 4-3 with a 100th-minute winner, a game of seven goals that could have been 17 after which Iglesias said: “If we’re going to lose, let it be like this.” Eight months on Celta beat them back, a 3-0 victory lifting them into a European place where they have not finished for a decade and embodying all they want to be. Iglesias was a ballboy back then and it was “cool”, he said, but not quite like this, grateful for the days he has been given.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/celta-vigo-claudio-giraldez-rafael-benitez-la-liga-feature\">Continue reading...</a>",
