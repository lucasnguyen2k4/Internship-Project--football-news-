This meant the video assistant referee could not intervene to rule on whether the forward had illegally kicked&nbsp;the ball from Altay Bayindir’s hands – as Bramall judged – and Unai&nbsp;Emery claimed later that this was the “key moment” that cost Villa Champions League ­qualification.</p><p>The incident happened in the 73rd minute with the game at Old Trafford goalless and as ­Newcastle were losing to Everton, Villa – despite having had Emi Martínez sent off – were heading for the ­Champions League. Bramall’s ruling caused a furious reaction from Emery and his staff. After this Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen goals – each provoking sarcastic Emery gestures – gave United a 2-0 win. The visitors ended in sixth and so will play Europa League football next season.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/aston-villa-referee-thomas-bramall-manchester-united-premier-league-football\">Continue reading...</a>",

Slot was never going to be a personality who generated headlines like Klopp did, keeping his cards close to his chest, but he always comes across as someone who is very personable and has brought the players closer together. Slot made Liverpool an efficient winning machine – rarely thrashing teams, often winning by the odd goal or two – and that allowed them to race to a second Premier League title.

Overall, though, he’s enjoyed a fine debut season, especially as, when he joined Spurs from Djurgården, there was little sense he’d establish himself so soon. But with a little help from injuries and incompetence, he forced his way into consideration and is now a fixture in Ange Postecoglou’s starting XI – with good reason. In this era of attacking and defensive prefixes, Bergvall is that rarity: a midfielder who plays in the middle of the field. Clever enough to create, calm enough to score, physical enough to tackle and athletic enough to harry, perhaps his best quality is his decision-making, especially notable for a player of his age.
