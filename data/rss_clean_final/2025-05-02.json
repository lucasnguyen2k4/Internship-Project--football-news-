    "summary": "<p>This week Nottingham Forest readied themselves for the Champions League, Evangelos Marinakis relinquishing his controlling interest in the club to comply with Uefa’s ownership rules. His other club, Greek champions Olympiakos, have qualified for the grandest stage in the club game but Forest’s bid to return to Europe’s premier competition will likely go to the wire. Will Forest look back on this defeat at home to Brentford as a costly misstep when their season ends here against Chelsea?</p><p>Forest, who face Crystal Palace, Leicester and West Ham before that potential final-day showdown with Chelsea, never really got going on a disappointing evening. Goals from Kevin Schade and Yoane Wissa, a January target for Forest, condemned the hosts to successive league home defeats for the first time since the end of last season and Nuno Espírito Santo’s side have now lost four of their past five matches in all competitions, including last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final. At full-time Anthony Elanga and Neco Williams crouched, winded by defeat, and Nuno’s challenge is to lift a dejected group of players. The stakes are a reminder of how far they have come.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/01/nottingham-forest-brentford-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Chelsea against the 11th best team in Sweden for a place in the final of the Conference League? A show of the Premier League’s financial power was inevitable. Enzo Fernández, signed for £106.7m, decorated the contest with early assists for Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke. Nicolas Jackson came off the bench and scored twice.
