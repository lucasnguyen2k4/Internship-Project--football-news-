Inter Miami <em>have </em>been terrible. Their complaints to the referee on Sunday <em>did</em> make their situation worse. These dynamics are not just surprising given Miami’s star-studded roster and record-setting performance last season, they are interesting. They are worth talking about and reacting to. They’re the sorts of things that get people thinking about the player, the team, the league, the sport. The more business-oriented among us may say they “drive engagement.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/20/messis-ire-is-free-publicity-for-mls-so-why-is-the-league-editing-it-out\">Continue reading...</a>",
