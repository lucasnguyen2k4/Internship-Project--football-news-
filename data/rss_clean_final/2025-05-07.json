Everything else he left behind at Montjuïc and San Siro, a statement stronger than any he had delivered in the press room. If that line was a promise, a demonstration of personality, it was kept, but Barcelona couldn’t reach their first final in a decade so he made another. “We won’t stop until this club is where it deserves to be: at the summit,” he wrote in the dark moments after defeat.</p><p>Here Barcelona had been stopped within touching distance. Lamine Yamal departed the pitch in silence holding Marcus Thuram’s shirt, Inter’s players coming to embrace this boy they had survived, a child born every 50 years in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/30/a-phenomenon-inzaghi-hails-lamine-yamal-after-his-star-turn-against-inter\">the words of their manager</a>, Simone Inzaghi. There has been something revelatory about the 17-year-old’s performance over two astonishing nights and at the end of it all there was almost a kind of reverence, a respect towards him. Inter had reached the final again and will talk of this forever, their everything; one day, they knew, he may be part of the epic stories they tell.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/07/fearless-lamine-yamal-leaves-his-mark-to-give-barcelona-hope-for-the-future\">Continue reading...</a>",
