    "summary": "<p>Palace’s best-paid player shows his class, Ipswich meet their fate and Mateo Kovacic sounds a warning </p><p>In April 1964 a side from north London came to Anfield with Liverpool one good result from winning the league, and conceded five. “Arsenal did little to allay the general suspicion that they were there just to be sacrificed,” Eric Todd wrote in his report for the Guardian. This time it was Tottenham but otherwise, for anyone whose memory stretches back 61 years it was a familiar story. Time and again Spurs meekly surrendered possession in dangerous areas, and while they defended in numbers – which suggests willing – they did so with terrifying inefficiency, which suggests poor organisation. Their focus is now fully on the Europa League, but if Liverpool had been a little more ruthless this would have been truly another real embarrassment in a season full of them. In April 1988 it was Spurs themselves who came to Anfield with Liverpool needing one point to guarantee the title. It had been a terrible season for Tottenham, and they were only just outside the bottom three. They lost 1-0. “Tottenham remain in the relegation penumbra,” wrote Stephen Bierley in his Guardian report. “Strange it seems that nobody much under the age of 30 will remember them being champions. Who would have thought it?” <strong>Simon Burnton</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/27/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 5-1 Tottenham</a></em></p><p><em>FA Cup report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/27/nottingham-forest-manchester-city-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report\">Nottm Forest 0-2 Man City</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/27/bournemouth-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Bournemouth 1-1 Man Utd</a></em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/28/premier-league-and-fa-cup-semis-10-talking-points-from-the-weekend\">Continue reading...</a>",
