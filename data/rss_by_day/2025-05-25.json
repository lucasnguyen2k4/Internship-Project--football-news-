Banned from the touchline after picking up a suspension against Newcastle last week, Mikel Arteta was seen deep in conversation with the Arsenal co-chair Josh Kroenke throughout as Kieran Tierney signed off with a goal before he returns to Celtic and Martin Ødegaard broke Southampton’s hearts with a late winner.</p><p>After a campaign in which no Arsenal player managed to score 10 league goals or more for the first time since 1924, summer recruitment plans were surely the main topic of discussion. Arteta’s selection of the ineffective Raheem Sterling for only the sixth time in a Premier League game since he joined on loan from Chelsea was perhaps another reminder of the Arsenal manager’s request for more firepower. If they need any inspiration to take the final step after being confirmed as runners-up for a third successive year, the success of Renée Slegers’ women’s team in becoming European champions against all the odds on Saturday night should provide it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/southampton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

They formed part of the post-match guard of honour for Ange Postecoglou and his players, the club’s newly anointed Europa League-winning heroes, the exterminators of the trophy drought. Postecoglou had embraced each of the legends and now they turned to applaud him.</p><p>It was a touching moment, one he is unlikely to forget as he luxuriated in the continued afterglow of Wednesday’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/europa-league-final-tottenham-manchester-united-match-report\">victory over Manchester United</a> in Bilbao – and sought to move on quickly from this latest Premier League capitulation.

Wolves supporters got to watch Matheus Cunha for potentially one final time in gold before his likely summer departure, while Brentford said goodbye to the chances of European football.</p><p>It was not a dead rubber at kick-off but considering the permutations it would take for Brentford to qualify for Europe, it was the equivalent of someone giving CPR to a bouncy ball.

There were plenty of raised eyebrows when Chelsea parted company with Mauricio Pochettino at the end of last season, just when it seemed the Argentinian had them on the right path, and brought in an inexperienced dogmatist from Leicester. Just when were these detached American owners going to get out of their own way? The accusations came thick and fast: the contracts being handed out were too long, vast quantities of money was being wasted on potential and now, with the appointment of a manager whose biggest achievement was winning the Championship with Leicester, it seemed Chelsea were in danger of joining Manchester United in the nether zone.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/enzo-maresca-chelsea-nottingham-forest-premier-league\">Continue reading...</a>",
