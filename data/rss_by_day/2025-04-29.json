    "summary": "<p>Young players are impressing across the country following the American league’s very un-American move</p><p>For the first time in its history, the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) commenced a regular season this spring with no draft. A quintessentially American event, defined by hopes and dreams being on public display while teams trade players into the professional leagues without their explicit input, was scrapped by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the NWSL and the NWSL Players Association in August.</p><p>In so doing, a league unafraid of reinvention became the first major professional sports league in the United States to forgo the draft. That’s a seismic shift by any measure, and while the move puts the NWSL in line with global football standards the long-term implications will take much longer to assess. After all, the draft was not simply an entertaining way to distribute talent while introducing them to the public on a celebratory stage; it was also a useful means of ensuring parity in a league proud of its competitiveness. In the words of the NWSL’s commissioner, Jessica Berman: “There actually is nothing to point to as a case study of how to make this transition, because there is no league that has gone from a world of a draft and having years of service, to being able to earn free agency and just having that melt away overnight.”</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

It couldn’t not be, given that five of the six teams battling to stay out of the two remaining places in the drop zone at stumps on Saturday have each notched up more than the 10 victories Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich have managed between them.</p><p>I told them, and I’m not exaggerating here, ‘Guys, bring your boots, bring your shorts, bring your T-shirts, and let’s play every ball together. We want to do something special’. That place has to be something that we haven’t seen before” – <s>John Sitton</s> Mikel Arteta apparently wants Arsenal fans to go the full John Terry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/28/mikel-arteta-arsenal-psg-champions-league-semi-final-fans-emirates-stadium\">when they take on PSG</a> in the first leg of their Bigger Cup semi-final.</p><p>If by Barry Glendenning’s reckoning ‘Arsenal are not a serious football club’ (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/28/liverpool-back-on-their-perch-football-daily-newsletter\">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>), I’m left to wonder how he might assess any of the 18 teams destined to finish below them in the Premier League table. I thank him mightily, however, for not only adding ‘heroic begrudgery’ to my phrase book but providing such a convincing demonstration” – Clinton Macsherry.</p><p>I have to disagree that Liverpool’s ‘This Means More’ motto has no meaning for their fanbase (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/28/liverpool-back-on-their-perch-football-daily-newsletter\">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>). If experience serves me right, for a generation of youngsters who just developed a passion for Liverpool after watching this season’s procession on the telly, This Means More than finding a team within geographical reach and paying to get in and cheer them on, thus actually, y’know, supporting. And This Means More than any concept of sporting loyalty and glory other than who just won. Hopefully, This Means More when Liverpool have a slight fallow patch down the road and they have to deal with the outrage when sometimes you don’t win. There is a widely spread demographic of folk in their 30s who once suddenly developed an affiliation with Manchester who could perhaps give them some tips for the future” – Jon Millard.</p><p>Congratulations to Truro on winning the National League South with a burst of three goals in the opening 10 minutes which gave the other contenders an absolute mountain to climb. Six clubs in the running as you reported last week but John Askey’s boys prevailed. Top contender for manager of the season, any league. No doubt the fans will be looking forward to the possibility of Carlisle, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Truro/Gateshead/@52.578825,-5.7388137,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x486b107cd55a1a75:0x616347ef951d07b4!2m2!1d-5.051041!2d50.263195!1m5!1m1!1s0x487e65525287ead7:0x594570c53db4f5c6!2m2!1d-1.603411!2d54.95268!3e0?entry=ttu&amp;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D\">Gateshead</a> and Hartlepool away next season” – Dave Step.</p><p>In the midst of all the kerfuffle of the weekend – Real Madrid players as petulant as ever, inflated and deflated managers brandishing their egos – it might have been good to see a mention from you of James Forrest of Celtic who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/26/celtic-win-55th-scottish-league-title\">collected his 26th trophy</a> in 524 appearances, overtaking the Lisbon Lion Bobby Lennox. What stands out about Forrest is his loyalty to the club and dedication to training and the squad, even when regularly on the bench. He has scored in each of the last 15 seasons so here’s hoping he grabs one before the end of this one. A model club player – something of a rarity these days” – Danny Sullivan.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/29/football-daily-newsletter-championship-relegation-battle\">Continue reading...</a>",
