Ultimately it may not matter and it arrived at the end of an evening that had often felt empty. Yet now it was full of noise, it meant the world to Ramón and for a moment everyone could just go wild, the defender’s strike in the 95th minute and Kylian Mbappé’s goal a quarter of an hour earlier overturning Martin Valjent’s 11th-minute opener.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/14/real-madrid-mallorca-la-liga-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
