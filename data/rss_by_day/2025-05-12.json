Following an early booking, Myles Lewis-Skelly, who began sketchily, found the measure of Mohamed Salah. There may be no tougher discipline for a defender in 2025. Does “MLS” have a long-term future as a defender or is his broad skillset better suited to midfield? The same questions have long been asked of Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose second-half arrival gave rise to a loud, vicious barracking, rancorous accusations of treachery that will grab headlines. If not unprecedented – Steve McManaman received similar treatment in 1999 – it was shocking to hear the Kop’s open contempt for one of their own, though one who has dared to flee the Merseyside nest. Before Alexander-Arnold’s arrival, Conor Bradley staked claims to be a first-teamer with typical ferocity in the tackle and speedy overlaps. He was also booked. As his replacement arrived to boos, the Kop pointedly sang the youngster’s name. <strong>John Brewin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/liverpool-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool 2-2 Arsenal</a></em></p><p><em>Match report:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/newcastle-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\"> Newcastle 2-0 Chelsea</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/manchester-united-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester United 0-2 West Ham</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/nottingham-forest-leicester-premier-league-match-report\">Nottingham Forest 2-2 Leicester</a></em></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/tottenham-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Tottenham 0-2 Crystal Palace</a></em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/12/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Continue reading...</a>",
