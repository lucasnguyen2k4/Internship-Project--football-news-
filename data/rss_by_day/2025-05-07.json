Heck, I bet even United don’t want United in the Premier, and they will soon demonstrate this by the most amusing tank yet in their playoff history. But if we are, à la Inter Miami, just going to decide who plays in a competition, in the same way we can decide what the inhabitants of Arctic land masses actually want, can we have Bristol City? I lately realised my tolerance for Frank Lampard had only increased because I hadn’t heard about him for a while, and Bristol City are way more romantic.
