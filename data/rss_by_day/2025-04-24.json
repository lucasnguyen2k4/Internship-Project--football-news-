Isn’t this supposed to be fun? </p><p>A chilly Saturday morning on the Astroturf pitches at Coram’s Fields in central London and several youth football matches are under way. I’m watching an under-11s game. The sound is the thud of boot on ball, the shrill interruption of the referee’s whistle, and a whole lot of shouting. From the players (“Mine!”, “Here!”, “Pass!”, “Ref!”, etc). From the two coaches (“Press!”, “Stay wide!”, “Push up!”, “Ref!”, etc). And from the touchline dads. There is one mum here today, but she’s less vocal.</p><p>To varying degrees, the dads are part fan, part coach, part personal trainer to their progeny. There is one dad (there’s always one) who’s taking it a bit further, who’s a bit shoutier than the others. “Get rid of it!” he screams at the defence, meaning hoof it upfield, which is the opposite of the coach’s instructions to play it out from the back. “Ref! Seriously?” he shouts at the referee (who’s only about 17 himself).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/one-father-threatened-to-stab-the-referee-why-does-kids-football-bring-out-the-worst-in-parents\">Continue reading...</a>",

Say there was 55,000, I’m betting you 50,000 would take this game with them.” Andy Gray’s words about the second leg of Everton’s semi-final against Bayern Munich in the Cup Winners’ Cup are not hyperbole. Admittedly the official crowd figure was 49,476 but, that apart, Gray is right about how Everton fans feel about the match of 24 April 1985. It was the ultimate night in the history of Goodison Park.</p><p>It was an evening that flooded the senses: two superb teams packed with great players were both chasing trebles. Neither of them took a backward step as the line between success and failure shifted throughout 90 minutes of intense football. And it was all played out in the kind of atmosphere that has to be heard to be believed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2025/apr/24/everton-bayern-munich-40-years-stadium-goodison-greatest-night\">Continue reading...</a>",

Ramsbottom United amassed 97 points and only finished third; eventual winners and my club Bury finished with a whopping 109. And we still needed a result on the final day to see off Merseyside outfit Lower Breck, with 8,700 people turning up at Gigg Lane to witness it, breaking the league’s attendance record by almost 3,000. Among that crowd was myself and my five-year-old son, who was born <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/bury-football-league-club-fans-club-collapse\">two weeks after we were expelled from the Football League</a>. Unfortunately he now thinks pitch invasions are a regular occurrence.

If he is feeling bruised after seeing Fulham fall to a last-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/20/fulham-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">defeat at home to Chelsea</a> he is hiding it well. Instead Khan, the vice-chairman and director of football operations, brings nothing but positivity when he breezes into a small, private room at Craven Cottage and starts to talk about his hopes for the future.</p><p>The most immediate issue is whether Fulham’s push for European qualification is still on. “Oh absolutely,” says Khan, on a flying visit to London from his Florida base. “We have a very good chance and we have so many exciting things we can achieve in the remaining fixtures. It’s been such a great season. There’s a lot of great things happening at the club. It’s been so fantastic. I’m really excited for the future.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/fulham-tony-khan-craven-cottage-builds-an-intimacy-theres-an-identity-to-the-club-interview\">Continue reading...</a>",

The scene aligns with some of the less glamorous stereotypes of working in recruitment and scouting: long nights journeying across the country alone, countless hours watching matches in all weather and often it will not even lead to signing the player. In women’s football, scouting is still in the embryonic stage of its development, but one Women’s Championship club is determined to change the perception of that and train up a new generation of scouts specifically skilled for the women’s game.</p><p>Gibson, recruitment manager for Southampton’s women’s and girls’ teams, is speaking to the Guardian about an initiative that his club is now running for a second successive season, named the Starling Bank Scout School, a 15-week programme that had 15 participants in 2024 and that has increased to 20 budding scouts for their current, ongoing class of 2025, and the scheme is heavily oversubscribed with 115 applicants for 2024 and now 160 applications for the latest programme.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.
