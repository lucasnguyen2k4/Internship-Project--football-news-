Villaâs director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, said shifting the game from Sunday to Friday was âclear prejudiceâ against the club and Villa objected to Spursâs request for it to be moved to aid their preparations for Wednesdayâs Europa League final. Villa were also privately perplexed at Bournemouthâs game with Manchester City being rearranged for Tuesday, after Saturdayâs FA Cup final, which is guaranteed to have implications on whether eighth place qualifies for the Europa Conference League. The flipside to all of this is Villa can get on the front foot, kicking off 45 minutes before Chelsea entertain Manchester United and two days before Nottingham Forest head to West Ham and Arsenal host Newcastle.
