    "summary": "<p>Eberechi Eze is too good for Palace, Morgan Gibbs-White is pushing for a call-up and is 2025 the year of the underdog?</p><p>Why would your fan-favourite player, scorer of That Historic Wembley Goal, in peak form under an excellent manager want to leave? Why would anyone be OK with it? How is this logical? Crystal Palace are now good enough to have Eberechi Eze in the team. Eberechi Eze is also too good to stay at Crystal Palace. Both of these things seem to be true. Oliver Glasner-era Palace are a seriously potent, organised and attractive team. But Eze’s progress is something else. At times during his early Palace career there was a sense of a slightly loose late-developer. His skill level was always exceptional. His use of it now is next-level, his finishing cold and his physique buffed up. Eze does not <em>really</em> have a ceiling. He could play for any team in Europe. But he is also 26 years old with two years left on his contract, and Palace have a model based on development with the likes of Romain Esse ready for a shot. There does not always have to be downside. Selling the man who made the thing happen can still be best for everyone. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/19/premier-league-and-fa-cup-final-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Continue reading...</a>",

It had been 10 long, hard months of “solidarity and commitment … methodology, work, honesty and dedication”, their manager said, yet this was no late lament, all that for nothing; instead, this was reward and release, “time to enjoy it”, to let go, so they did. Outside at Montjuïc, Barcelona had begun their party, even 2025’s first league defeat and killjoy keeper Wojciech Szczesny saving an <a href=\"https://x.com/carrusel/status/1924226920863953122\">outrageous overhead kick</a> from his own son not spoiling the fun; inside the dressing room, the club from the small town 200 miles south had begun theirs too, and nothing could ruin this either. Someone put <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo7MpQZRd5Q\">La Morocha</a> on and the players were bouncing about, drumming the rhythm on the ceiling when, in another triumph for cheap construction, the first beam came down. Captain Juan Foyth, looking like a kid who’d put a football through the neighbour’s window, raised his arm to protect his teammates, quietly laid it to one side, <a href=\"https://x.com/DAZN_ES/status/1924182699452837948\">and they carried on</a>.</p><p>The track was changed, Handel now, and they lined up.

All of them scatted and sang, at least the word they knew: maybe not <em>die meister</em>, maybe not <em>die besten</em> or <em>les grandes équipes</em>, and definitely not <em>eine grosse sportliche veranstaltung</em>, but certainly <em>the champions</em>. The flag they carried read “the village wants the Champions League” and now they had it. Villarreal, the team from the place whose population could fit into Montjuïc, had come to Catalonia, handed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/15/barcelona-la-liga-title-win-espanyol-real-madrid-lamine-yamal\">newly crowned champions</a> a guard of honour and then beaten them 3-2, helped by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/16/la-liga-title-hansi-flick-barcelona\">Barça’s hangovers</a>, to secure fifth and a return to Europe’s biggest competition with a week to spare.
