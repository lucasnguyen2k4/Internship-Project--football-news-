Sure, Athletic Club can only recruit players from an area the size of Wales, were missing their first-choice centre-back Dani Vivian through suspension, their best three attacking players through injury (Iñaki and Nico Williams, plus Oihan Sancet), were 3-0 down from the first leg and still gave United’s band of global internationals a frightful scare by taking a first-half lead at Old Trafford. But fair play to United, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/08/manchester-united-athletic-bilbao-europa-league-semi-final-match-report\">they roared back in the second half</a>, and ended as comfortable winners, 4-1 on the night and 7-1 on aggregate. In reaching the final, Ruben Amorim has a real and tangible reason to be proud of his team, and it’s also nice to see Mason Mount being good at football again.</p><p>Re: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/08/football-daily-arsenal-psg-bigger-cup\">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>. Can I suggest that after Arsenal provide a guard of honour on Sunday, Liverpool repay the compliment twice to acknowledge the titles Arsenal would have won in the last two seasons if it wasn’t for the pesky ‘team with the greatest number of points is first’ nonsense?” – Dominic Hodgson.</p><p>One point that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/08/football-daily-arsenal-psg-bigger-cup\">yesterday’s Football Daily</a> omitted – Arsenal got further in Bigger Cup than rivals Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Manchester City. I rather suspect that Mikel Arteta would be mildly pleased if you now referred to the semi-finals as the new ‘Round of Arsenal’” – Mike Wilner.</p><p>Apologies to anyone who watched Salford (yesterday’s Class of 25, full email edition) in the Northern Premier back in the day, but Salford City? <em>Salford City</em>? The answer to the problems with football in that area of Manchester is Salford City? I’m no fan of FC United, to be honest (the angst is wearing), but if jaded millionaires really wanted to make a statement and pose an existential crisis to the club that made them and yet is tanking under a leveraged buyout, there was one obvious choice. But no, they went for the vanity-stroking path of high fives with Tom Brady and Ryan Reynolds in a dull Netflix documentary about the Championship playoff struggle.

    "summary": "<p>Fans protested against the leveraged takeover but were offered little support and the toxicity has had a lasting impact</p><p>The first time the Glazer family visited Old Trafford, in June 2005, they paid a visit to the megastore. Outside, hundreds of furious Manchester United fans turned up with banners and placards, shouted slogans such as “Die Glazer die”, and a few clashed with police. Inside, the Glazers were doing a spot of – and here we must stretch the word to its broadest possible definition – shopping.</p><p>For Joel, Avram and Bryan had no intention of doing anything quite as undignified as parting with their own cash. Instead they swarmed the aisles, scooped up armfuls of replica shirts and merchandise, which shop staff dutifully ran through the tills and bagged up. When the time came to leave, the Glazers simply took the bags and left. This was, after all, all their own property, theirs to take and use as they pleased. And as a metaphor for how they intended to run Manchester United over the next 20 years, it is about as good as any.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/two-decades-glazers-debt-of-morals-manchester-united\">Continue reading...</a>",

No team has ever entered the English playoffs in worse form than Sunderland, after their five successive defeats, but goals from Wilson Isidor, his first in 14 games, and Eliezer Mayenda, after a disastrous back-pass from Milan van Ewijk, enabled Sunderland to earn their first victory over Coventry since 2007 and become favourites to reach the Wembley final against either Sheffield United or Bristol City on 24 May.</p><p>Jack Rudoni, who grew up a Chelsea fan, Frank Lampard his hero, had headed Coventry level within two minutes of Isidor breaking his long goal drought. But then, in the 88th minute, Mayenda was gifted a clear run on goal by Van Ewijk’s nightmare of a blind pass back towards his goalkeeper Ben Wilson. The Spanish striker rounded the Sunderland academy graduate in Coventry’s net and scored the goal that has turned expectations on their head. The 2,400 travelling Sunderland fans reprised the Roker roar in their small corner of the CBS Arena.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/coventry-sunderland-championship-playoff-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
