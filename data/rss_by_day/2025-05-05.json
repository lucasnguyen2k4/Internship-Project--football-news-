    "summary": "<p>Jamie Vardy targets double century, Jérémy Doku makes his mark and Arsenal rue the absence of Gabriel Magalhães</p><p>There is rarely an opportunity for champions to show a sentimental side. It is such hard work to win a title over a 38-game season, with the race often going down to the wire. Arne Slot had four matches to spare and used the trip to Stamford Bridge to give first league starts of the season to Wataru Endo and Harvey Elliott. The former has been used frequently as a late sub while the latter is often brought on to make an attacking impact, but the form of their teammates and Elliott’s long-term injury have limited chances under Slot. Jarell Quansah was given a rare start and Federico Chiesa was permitted a fifth league game which qualifies him for a medal. The four have rarely let Liverpool down; no one can blame Quansah for the own goal but he looked understandably rusty and tired when he gave away the penalty. They will have to decide if they want to be bit-part players at a title-winning club or drop down to be key men elsewhere. <strong>Will Unwin</strong></p><p><em>Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/04/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">Chelsea 3-1 Liverpool</a></p><p><em>Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/04/brentford-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Brentford 4-3 Manchester United</a></p><p><em>Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/03/leicester-southampton-premier-league-match-report\">Leicester 2-0 Southampton</a></p><p><em>Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/02/manchester-city-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City 1-0 Wolves</a></p><p><em>Match report: </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/03/aston-villa-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">Aston Villa 1-0 Fulham</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/05/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action\">Continue reading...</a>",

And, like a lot of what is said there, it was just a joke, even if there were true words said in jest, born of fondness and admiration, a kind of desperation too, a disbelief that <em>he</em> is here with <em>them</em> and a determination to keep it that way. There was no anonymous letter this time, no ransom note cut from newspaper letters; instead, there was a message on Isco’s Instagram. “Antonio of Triana,” it read, “we’re going to kidnap you: this is your first warning.” A few days later, the second came. “If I have to provide the car to kidnap him, I will,” said former Betis player Joaquín. “However it happens, he has to stay.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/05/antony-real-betis-isco-kidnap-manchester-united-la-liga\">Continue reading...</a>",
