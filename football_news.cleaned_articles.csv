The scene aligns with some of the less glamorous stereotypes of working in recruitment and scouting: long nights journeying across the country alone, countless hours watching matches in all weather and often it will not even lead to signing the player. In women’s football, scouting is still in the embryonic stage of its development, but one Women’s Championship club is determined to change the perception of that and train up a new generation of scouts specifically skilled for the women’s game.</p><p>Gibson, recruitment manager for Southampton’s women’s and girls’ teams, is speaking to the Guardian about an initiative that his club is now running for a second successive season, named the Starling Bank Scout School, a 15-week programme that had 15 participants in 2024 and that has increased to 20 budding scouts for their current, ongoing class of 2025, and the scheme is heavily oversubscribed with 115 applicants for 2024 and now 160 applications for the latest programme.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.

And we still needed a result on the final day to see off Merseyside outfit Lower Breck, with 8,700 people turning up at Gigg Lane to witness it, breaking the league’s attendance record by almost 3,000.

At the end of Celta de Vigo’s victory over Villarreal on Wednesday, players and staff crouched low before fans and for the first time a hush fell over Balaídos. All together now, the chant started slowly, quietly, whispered, but the pace quickened and the volume grew bit by bit until they burst to their feet, belted out their name and bounced off each other, footballers fell into the net laughing and one thought emerged above any other: <a href=""https://x.com/DAZN_ES/status/1915122052618498333"">how much fun they were having</a>.</p><p>This is the way football’s supposed to be – about enjoying, about belonging – and this is the way it has been since Claudio Giráldez came along: good even when it has been bad and getting better all the time. The last time Celta played Villarreal they were beaten 4-3 with a 100th-minute winner, a game of seven goals that could have been 17 after which Iglesias said: “If we’re going to lose, let it be like this.” Eight months on Celta beat them back, a 3-0 victory lifting them into a European place where they have not finished for a decade and embodying all they want to be. Iglesias was a ballboy back then and it was “cool”, he said, but not quite like this, grateful for the days he has been given.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/celta-vigo-claudio-giraldez-rafael-benitez-la-liga-feature"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-24T22:41:58,Guardian

Having moved to Germany from the French side Sochaux as a 20-year-old after coming through the prestigious Clairefontaine academy, he reunited with Oliver Glasner – his former manager at Wolfsburg – in south London last summer. The elegant defender is the heartbeat of the Palace side that will face Aston Villa for a place in the final and has been tipped to win his first senior cap sooner rather than later after representing France at every youth level.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/24/maxence-lacroix-crystal-palace-one-day-i-will-be-in-france-team-but-want-to-win-fa-cup"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-25T04:30:15,Guardian

He has adored coaching since first taking sessions at the Stavanger club Vidar, whose young team included the future Fulham defender Brede Hangeland. In the past two months, combining those passions, he has fallen for Crystal Palace because of their “underdog, competitive spirit”, since becoming their women’s team manager. Now, to try to save their top-flight status, he must call upon the skills he has honed in another of the loves of his professional life: psychology.</p><p>Smerud, having studied and taught sport psychology academically and worked as a clinical psychologist at a private practice, is as qualified as anybody to discuss the mental side of football. “I was very keen, when I was very young, to understand how some teams have great players but don’t perform,” he says, “while other teams have much lesser names but they perform.” How, then, can this expertise help Palace’s mentality as they enter their final three games knowing that they need to win all three to have any chance of avoiding relegation back to the Women’s Championship?</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/25/leif-smerud-crystal-palace-women-manager-psychologist-interview"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-25T18:00:47,Guardian

Pretty quickly these sightings take on the status of urban myths; brief brushes with the divine. There was the time he was at a petrol station and decided to pay for everyone’s fuel. There was the kid who chased after his car, went smack into a lamppost and now boasts a photograph of himself with a lavishly bloodied nose, and Mohamed Salah’s arm tenderly clasped around his shoulder.</p><p>A few weeks ago, with that new contract still unsigned, a rumour spread around the city that Salah was out at the docks filming content for the club’s media channels. Invariably by the time the crowds arrived he was gone. For the people of Liverpool, their greatest footballer is someone really only seen in snatches: a blur, a whisper, a trick of the light.

Maybe the polarities have flipped once in the new economic environment and this has become the main event once again.</p><p>You’d probably need a few more aspirational Championship sides to start taking the FA Cup more seriously before you made that argument too seriously but, equally, the Premier League’s middle-class is burgeoning. With the gulf to the second flight growing, they can afford to be a little less troubled by the prospect of relegation, while qualification for the Champions League remains a distant prospect. In the circumstances, the only viable goal for that tier of sides is to take the FA Cup seriously.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/26/fa-cup-crystal-palace-aston-villa-enjoy-old-school-wembley-day"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-27T02:14:35,Guardian

Here’s a bit of Todd’s missive:</p><p>Having already exhausted most of the available superlatives on the team, Mr W Shankly, its manager, and the Kop, I can think of no more fitting a preface to my last dispatch from Anfield than a statement by Mr Shankly shortly after Liverpool had won promotion. “We are not merely going to be sitting on the First Division fence,” he said. They finished a useful eighth last term and, after a modest start, they dropped several broad hints that they intended winning something this season.</p><p>Yet Saturday’s proceedings were less satisfying than had been expected or hoped for. For one thing, there were fewer than 50,000 spectators – some of them had queued all night, and others for seven hours. For another, Liverpool made rather more mistakes than usual, and finally Arsenal did little to allay the general suspicion that they were there just to be sacrificed. The atmosphere was charged with tension and emotion, so that perhaps it would be unfair to be hypercritical. The indisputable fact remains, however, that Liverpool did what they set out to do. They are worthy champions, and Arsenal, who have enjoyed a good share of the game’s honours over the years, paid them generous tribute.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/apr/27/liverpool-tottenham-premier-league-live"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-27T22:30:44,Guardian

This time it was Tottenham but otherwise, for anyone whose memory stretches back 61 years it was a familiar story. Time and again Spurs meekly surrendered possession in dangerous areas, and while they defended in numbers – which suggests willing – they did so with terrifying inefficiency, which suggests poor organisation. Their focus is now fully on the Europa League, but if Liverpool had been a little more ruthless this would have been truly another real embarrassment in a season full of them. In April 1988 it was Spurs themselves who came to Anfield with Liverpool needing one point to guarantee the title. It had been a terrible season for Tottenham, and they were only just outside the bottom three. They lost 1-0. “Tottenham remain in the relegation penumbra,” wrote Stephen Bierley in his Guardian report. “Strange it seems that nobody much under the age of 30 will remember them being champions.

That is the first thing that left a mark on me. What is remarkable about him is his personality and the maturity for his age, and to what extent everything is already aligned in his daily life and his way of working.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/29/desire-doue-psg-serious-precocious-unique-winger"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-04-29T16:30:37,Guardian

The only problem, though, was that Chelsea were already four goals to the good by the time Isak Alemayehu Mulugeta got the underdogs on the scoresheet in Stockholm.</p><p>It was not a great look for a competition that Uefa invented for the benefit of Europe’s smaller clubs. Chelsea against the 11th best team in Sweden for a place in the final of the Conference League? A show of the Premier League’s financial power was inevitable. Enzo Fernández, signed for £106.7m, decorated the contest with early assists for Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke. Nicolas Jackson came off the bench and scored twice. Cole Palmer’s failure to end his goal drought was a sideshow.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/01/chelsea-djurgarden-conference-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-05-02T04:00:46,Guardian

It had been hard to hear yourself think as the emotions of a frustrating campaign poured out with each goal that went in, with Brennan Johnson’s opener after just 38 seconds setting the tone.</p><p>But this being Spurs, things are never quite that simple. Cruising at 3-0 after further goals from James Maddison and Dominic Solanke seemed to have given them a comfortable advantage, a late strike from Bodø/Glimt’s stand-in captain, Ulrik Saltnes, that deflected off the unfortunate Micky van de Ven changed the complexion of the tie in an instant.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/01/tottenham-bodo-glimt-europa-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-05-02T04:12:44,Guardian

They are now sixth after a 2-0 loss to Everton in Sunday’s Merseyside derby at Anfield, which also means they have still only ever won once at the stadium. Liverpool’s position in the table could get worse with one game of the season remaining, with three teams still able to overtake them, including Everton, whose win against their local rivals was secured thanks to goals from Katja Snoeijs and Karen Holmgaard.

Raised in <em>Inferninho</em> (Little Hell), a favela outside São Paulo, the way the Real Betis winger tells it, he grew up without shoes to play in or a bed of his own to sleep in, surrounded by drugs and guns. Some days he wouldn’t eat and one day, when he was six or seven, he had to jump over a dead body to get to school. Life was just the way it was, even on the rough concrete courts where his bleeding feet moved faster than the rest. “I played against traffickers and all sorts,” he said. “If you ask if I was scared, of course I was. But I always had a strong personality and the harder it was, the more I wanted to be there.”</p><p>So when someone threatened to kidnap him a week ago, Antony just laughed – and so did everyone else. This wasn’t São Paulo, this was Seville. And, like a lot of what is said there, it was just a joke, even if there were true words said in jest, born of fondness and admiration, a kind of desperation too, a disbelief that <em>he</em> is here with <em>them</em> and a determination to keep it that way. There was no anonymous letter this time, no ransom note cut from newspaper letters; instead, there was a message on Isco’s Instagram. “Antonio of Triana,” it read, “we’re going to kidnap you: this is your first warning.” A few days later, the second came. “If I have to provide the car to kidnap him, I will,” said former Betis player Joaquín. “However it happens, he has to stay.”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/05/antony-real-betis-isco-kidnap-manchester-united-la-liga"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-05-05T22:56:00,Guardian

Inside, the Glazers were doing a spot of – and here we must stretch the word to its broadest possible definition – shopping.</p><p>For Joel, Avram and Bryan had no intention of doing anything quite as undignified as parting with their own cash. Instead they swarmed the aisles, scooped up armfuls of replica shirts and merchandise, which shop staff dutifully ran through the tills and bagged up. When the time came to leave, the Glazers simply took the bags and left. This was, after all, all their own property, theirs to take and use as they pleased. And as a metaphor for how they intended to run Manchester United over the next 20 years, it is about as good as any.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/two-decades-glazers-debt-of-morals-manchester-united"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-05-10T02:00:32,Guardian

No team has ever entered the English playoffs in worse form than Sunderland, after their five successive defeats, but goals from Wilson Isidor, his first in 14 games, and Eliezer Mayenda, after a disastrous back-pass from Milan van Ewijk, enabled Sunderland to earn their first victory over Coventry since 2007 and become favourites to reach the Wembley final against either Sheffield United or Bristol City on 24 May.</p><p>Jack Rudoni, who grew up a Chelsea fan, Frank Lampard his hero, had headed Coventry level within two minutes of Isidor breaking his long goal drought. But then, in the 88th minute, Mayenda was gifted a clear run on goal by Van Ewijk’s nightmare of a blind pass back towards his goalkeeper Ben Wilson. The Spanish striker rounded the Sunderland academy graduate in Coventry’s net and scored the goal that has turned expectations on their head. The 2,400 travelling Sunderland fans reprised the Roker roar in their small corner of the CBS Arena.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/coventry-sunderland-championship-playoff-match-report"">Continue reading...</a>",2025-05-10T04:02:07,Guardian
